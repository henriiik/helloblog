## [WASM!](/blog/2018-03-26-wasm-bang)

## What?

Run rust in the browser! Like js!

## Really?

Well, no.

> WebAssembly is a simple machine model and executable format with an extensive specification.

I pulled the above quote from [the official rust + wasm book](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-wasm/background-and-concepts.html#web-assembly), it has a very good explanation and I recommend you check it out!

That said, it is runnable in browsers, and you can compile rust to it.

(I also added some sweet blockquote styles to the blog)

## Getting Started

The book seems to be a good place to start. Handily it has a section called [Getting Started](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-wasm/setup.html#getting-started) which advises us to install the wasm toolchain and `wasm-gc`, so lets do that.

```
$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
info: downloading component 'rust-std' for 'wasm32-unknown-unknown'
info: installing component 'rust-std' for 'wasm32-unknown-unknown'
$ cargo install wasm-gc
    Updating registry `https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index`
 Downloading wasm-gc v0.1.1
  Installing wasm-gc v0.1.1
```

## Hello World!

Next up in the book is the [Hello World](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-wasm/hello-world.html). I followed the instructions there but relaying the info here would more or less be copy-pasting the contents of the book so its better if you just check it out directly if you ware interested.

I did however find a small problem and [submitted a PR to fix it](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-wasm/pull/94). open source! yay!

## WASM on the blog

### In the repo

To tie in this to the blog thing I think it would be cool to perhaps append a little message from the rust wasm to the end of every page or something. Like `Hello from WASM` or some such.

I am guessing that it is easiest to think of the blog and the wasm to be different projects for now so i'll move the `hello-world` folder into the `helloblog` folder, rename it to `hellowasm`, and do a search and replace on `hello-world` to `hellowasm`.

I also created a build script to run the wasm build commands, so I don't have to remember them.

```
cargo +nightly build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
wasm-gc target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/hellowasm.wasm -o hellowasm.gc.wasm
```

In the `hello-world` example, the js to instantiate the wasm was inline in the html file, but i think it's time to add a `hello.js` for the blog.

```
fetch("/hellowasm/hellowasm.gc.wasm")
  .then(r => r.arrayBuffer())
  .then(r => WebAssembly.instantiate(r))
  .then(wasm_module => {
    const element = document.createElement("small");
    element.appendChild(
      document.createTextNode(
        `Hello from WASM! 2 + 1 = ${wasm_module.instance.exports.add_one(2)}`
      )
    );
    document.body.appendChild(element);
  });
```

I adapted the js from the the hello world project to append an element with the result from the wasm call.

### Routes and such

I though I could just stick the files in the root of the repo, but I realized that the server appends `.md` to the url and looks in the pages folder. So I guess it's time for a `static` folder. A better name would be.. better, but I can't think of one.

So back to the rocket docs i go. Fortunately rocket has a `NamedFile` responder with a [perfect example](https://rocket.rs/guide/responses/#option) in the docs for how to return an `Option`. It even uses the folder name `static`. With some slight modification it's ready to go! (I'm hoping that the ordering of the routes will give the new route priority over the pages route.)

```
#[get("/")]
fn index() -> Result<Html<String>, NotFound<String>> {
    page(PathBuf::from("index"))
}

#[get("/static/<file..>")]
fn file(file: PathBuf) -> Option<NamedFile> {
    NamedFile::open(Path::new("static/").join(file)).ok()
}

#[get("/<path..>")]
fn page(mut path: PathBuf) -> Result<Html<String>, NotFound<String>> {
    // content excluded for berevity
}

fn main() {
    rocket::ignite()
        .mount("/", routes![index, file, page])
        .launch();
}
```

Nope.

```

```

I guess it's back to the docs. Look's like there is something called [forwarding](https://rocket.rs/guide/requests/#forwarding) that could possible help this issue.

```
#[get("/static/<file..>")]
fn file(file: PathBuf) -> Option<NamedFile> {
    NamedFile::open(Path::new("static/").join(file)).ok()
}

#[get("/<path..>", rank = 2)]
fn page(mut path: PathBuf) -> Result<Html<String>, NotFound<String>> {
    // content excluded for berevity
}
```

By adding a rank to the second route, rocket knows to prioritize the first route (hopefully). The first route (and the second) should default to a rank of -1 according to [the default ranking table](https://rocket.rs/guide/requests/#default-ranking).

```

SUCCESS!

Clicking the link presents us with the fabulous index page!

And these logs. Looks like the console printing it a little bit off, but the site works great!

```
GET / text/html:
GET /static/hellowasm.gc.wasm:
GET /static/hello.js:
    =>     =>     => Matched: GET /
Matched: GET /static/<file..>
Matched: GET /static/<file..>
    =>     => Outcome: Success
Outcome: Success
    => Outcome: Success
    => Response succeeded.
    => Response succeeded.
    => Response succeeded.
```

Now that we have this fancy static folder functionality why not extract the css into a file and request it as well. And while we're at it, why not throw in the blogs first picture! (Right after i look up the syntax for images in markdown.)

BAM!

## Finishing up

I added some styles for `<small>` and `<img>` to make it all look nice. If all goes well, you should be able to see some text below this paragraph that contains a number calculated in WASM!
